# Exploratory-data-analysis
- In this section, case studies from online data were examined to understand the relationship of present features in the dataset.
- Python codes are developed to analyze the data features and then plot the results using matplotlib and seaborn packages.
- The findings were observed in a separate PowerPoint file.

# Case study 's topics 
1. Breast cancer: To predict "Maglinent" vs " Benign" with Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Machine
2. Forest Fire: To evaluate factors causing forest fire
   
Overall, Python codes were written to 
   - Find the correlation betwwen variables
   - Dectect of outliers 
   - Drop unnecessary variables
   - Develop classification models to predict certain circumtances.
